## 4. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Unique Differentiators (What No One Else Does)

1. **183-day tax residency tracking** -- No Spanish tool tracks this. Cross-border autonomos currently use Excel or manual counting.
2. **Spain-Belgium treaty compliance** -- No tool provides treaty-specific guidance (Art. 4 tie-breaker, Art. 9.1.b family presumption).
3. **Per diem (dietas) calculation** -- No tool calculates Belgium-specific daily allowances tied to calendar days.
4. **Cross-border scenario modeling** -- No tool lets you compare revenue scenarios with Belgium travel cost patterns.
5. **IRPF net income calculator** -- While others file Modelo 130, none show the full "invoice to take-home" pipeline.

### 4.2 Market Gap

The Spanish autonomo tool market splits into two categories:
- **Software tools** (Holded, Quipu, Billin, Contasimple, Anfix): Focus on invoicing + accounting + tax filing. None address cross-border complexity.
- **Advisory services** (Declarando, Txerpa): Pair software with human advisors. Good for general autonomos, but no cross-border expertise baked in.

**This app occupies a third position:** A specialized cross-border tax planning tool that no existing product serves. The 30,000+ Spanish autonomos working in EU countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France) currently have zero purpose-built tools.

### 4.3 Competitive Threats

1. **Declarando could add cross-border features** -- They have the tax expertise and advisor network. However, their current focus is domestic autonomos.
2. **Holded or Anfix could partner with a tax advisory** -- Adding cross-border modules to their ERP. Unlikely short-term (low ROI for a niche).
3. **International tools (Xero, Zoho) expanding to Spain** -- They have multi-currency and international tax features but lack Spanish fiscal specifics (Modelos, RETA, dietas).

### 4.4 Pricing Strategy Recommendation

| Tier | Price | Features | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Free** | 0 EUR | IRPF calculator, scenario comparisons, 183-day counter | Hook. Compete with Contasimple free tier. |
| **Profesional** | 9.90 EUR/month | + Expense tracking, invoicing, calendar, client management | Below Quipu (13 EUR), competitive with Anfix (5.99-14.99 EUR) |
| **Cross-Border** | 19.90 EUR/month | + Belgium/any-country dietas, treaty compliance, multi-currency, tax calendar | Unique tier. No competitor offers this. |
| **Advisory** | 49.90 EUR/month | + Quarterly gestor review, filing assistance, optimization tips | Below Declarando (70 EUR), above Txerpa (~37 EUR) |

| **Addressable market** | 6/10 | ~30K cross-border autonomos (niche); potentially all 3.3M autonomos if generalized |
