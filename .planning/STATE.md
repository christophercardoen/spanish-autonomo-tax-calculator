### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|

| 4-phase minimo method | Official AEAT methodology: minimos reduce TAX, not taxable BASE | 01-01 |
| Gastos dificil at 5% (not 7%) | 7% was exceptional for 2023; reverted to 5% with 2000 EUR cap for 2024+ | 01-01 |
| Cumulative baseTax for brackets | Ensures accuracy at bracket boundaries | 01-01 |
| Tooltip pattern for citations | Hover tooltips keep UI clean while providing source info on demand | 01-02 |
