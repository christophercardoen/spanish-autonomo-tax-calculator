# Phase 7.2: UI/UX Polish & Generalization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Comprehensive visual and functional refinement of the calculator - professional visual polish with refined dark theme, all bugs fixed (calculation, UI, mobile), zero Dutch text ("Leefgeld" → "Disposable Income"), Belgium costs converted to regular expense system, tested across all device sizes (iPhone SE to desktop).

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual design refinement
- **Dark theme:** Keep current charcoal #1a1a1a background (pure neutral, no changes)
- **Spacing system:** 8px base scale (8/16/24/32/40px) for consistent, compact spacing
- **Color coding:** Keep current semantic colors ONLY (green=positive, red=negative, orange=warning) - no accent color expansion
- **Typography:** Replace JetBrains Mono with **Roboto Mono** for all numbers/financial data
- **Typography:** Keep DM Sans for UI text (no changes)
- **Hover effects:** Add transition smoothing - refine animation timing/easing for smoother feel (keep -4px lift + glow)
- **Border radius:** Increase border radius for more rounded, softer appearance
- **Shadows:** Stronger shadows for more pronounced depth and card separation

### Terminology & localization
- **Leefgeld replacement:** "Disposable Income" throughout UI
- **Spanish fiscal terms:** Keep Spanish in parentheses - e.g., "Difficult-to-Prove Expenses (Gastos Difícil Justificación)"
- **Belgium-specific language:** Replace with "Cross-Border" - e.g., "Cross-Border Work Days", "Cross-Border Work Costs"
- **Expense labels:** Full descriptive format - e.g., "Rent (30% deductible)" with percentage in label
- **Zero Dutch text:** All UI elements must be English (already largely complete from Phase 7.1)

### Belgium costs generalization
- **Pattern toggle removal:** DELETE the 1K vs 2.5K Belgium cost toggle completely - users add expenses manually
- **Category structure:** Create new "Cross-Border Work" category (separate from Spain Deductible)
- **Expense sections:** TWO sections only - "Business Expenses (all deductible)" + "Private Costs"
  - Business Expenses section includes both Spain deductible AND Cross-Border Work items
  - Private Costs remains separate (non-deductible)
- **Data migration:** Clear localStorage and start fresh - users re-enter all expenses
- **Belgium-specific code:** Remove all hardcoded Belgium logic (toggles, patterns, special-casing)

### Bug fixes & testing
- **Priority:** ALL bugs must be fixed - zero tolerance for errors (calculation, UI, mobile, state persistence)
- **Testing approach:** Both manual + automated testing required before delivery
  - Automated: JavaScript test suite that runs in browser console
  - Manual: Visual/UX verification of all features
- **Mobile testing viewports:**
  - iPhone SE (375x667)
  - iPhone 14 Pro (393x852)
  - iPad (768x1024)
  - Desktop breakpoints (1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768)
- **Edge case handling:** Claude's discretion (validation, error messages, graceful degradation)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact transition timing/easing curves for hover effects
- Specific border radius values (just "more rounded")
- Shadow blur/spread values (just "stronger")
- Edge case error handling approach (validation vs graceful degradation)
- Automated test coverage scope
- Manual testing checklist details

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User emphasized: "No errors allowed and pre-testing always required before you can deliver"
- Testing must cover ALL breakpoints comprehensively
- Professional financial dashboard aesthetic must be maintained
- Roboto Mono specifically chosen for number font replacement

## Deferred Ideas

None - discussion stayed within phase scope
