  <what-built>
Complete Phase 7.2 UI/UX Polish:
- All "Leefgeld" replaced with "Disposable Income" (Plan 7.2-01)
- Visual polish applied: spacing tokens, shadows, hover effects, focus states (Plan 7.2-01)
- Belgium hardcoding removed: Work Travel Expenses section with editable items (Plan 7.2-02)
- Mobile and desktop layouts audited and fixed (Plan 7.2-03)
- Cross-browser compatibility verified (Plan 7.2-03)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Please test the dashboard comprehensively:

**Desktop Testing (1920x1080 or 1440x900):**
1. Open autonomo_dashboard.html in Chrome/Safari
2. Verify all tabs work: Scenarios, Calendar, Expenses, Details, Compliance
3. Test scenario cards - hover should lift smoothly with shadow animation
4. Test comparison table - horizontal scroll should have sticky first column
5. Test calendar - click days, use week/month selection, multi-select with shift-click
6. Test expense section - "Work Travel Expenses" should show individual items (NOT Low/High toggle)
7. Test adding an expense - button should work, form should appear
8. Test tooltips - click ? icons, modal should appear centered with backdrop
9. Test export functions (ICS, CSV, clipboard)
10. Test keyboard navigation - Tab through interface, focus indicators should be visible

**Mobile Testing (375px or 428px width):**
1. Open Chrome DevTools, toggle device toolbar
2. Set to iPhone SE (375x667) or iPhone 14 Pro Max (430x932)
3. Verify all tabs are accessible without horizontal scroll
4. Verify scenario cards stack vertically
5. Verify calendar days are touchable size (at least 40px)
6. Verify modals fit within viewport
7. Verify add expense form works on mobile

**Language Check:**
1. Search for "Leefgeld" via Cmd+F - should find 0 visible matches
2. All labels should be English
3. Subtitle should show "2025/2026" tax calculator

**Calculation Verification:**
1. Check Scenario C calculation matches expected:
   - Revenue: 9,000/month
   - Expected "Disposable Income": ~3,500-4,000/month
2. Edit a scenario and verify recalculation works
3. Create a custom scenario from template
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if everything looks good and ready for Phase 8.

If issues found, describe them specifically:
- What feature/area has the bug
- What you expected vs what happened
- Screenshot or steps to reproduce if possible

I will fix all issues before completing this phase.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix Reported Issues (if any)</name>
  <files>autonomo_dashboard.html</files>
  <action>
This task executes ONLY if user reports issues in Task 1.

For each issue reported:
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify the root cause
3. Implement the fix
4. Verify the fix works
5. Check for regressions

Common issues and fixes:

**Tooltip issues:**
- If tooltip doesn't center: Check CSS position/transform
- If backdrop doesn't blur: Check backdrop-filter support
- If doesn't close: Check click handler on backdrop

**Add expense issues:**
- If button doesn't respond: Check event listener attachment
- If form doesn't appear: Check display toggle logic
- If save doesn't work: Check form submission handler

**Mobile layout issues:**
- If horizontal scroll: Add overflow-x: hidden or fix wide elements
- If touch targets too small: Increase min-width/min-height to 44px
- If modals cut off: Add max-height and overflow scroll

**Calculation issues:**
- If wrong values: Check expense category summing
- If NaN appears: Check for undefined values in calculation chain

After fixing, ask user to re-verify the specific issue.
