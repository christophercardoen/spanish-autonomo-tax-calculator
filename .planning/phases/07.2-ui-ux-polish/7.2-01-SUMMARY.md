  added: []
  patterns:
    - CSS custom properties for spacing scale (--spacing-xs to --spacing-2xl)

  - "6-step spacing scale (4px to 48px) for consistent component spacing"
  - "3-tier radius tokens (4px, 8px, 12px) for consistent roundness"

patterns-established:
  - "Spacing tokens: --spacing-xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl for all component spacing"

# Phase 7.2 Plan 01: English Localization & Visual Polish Summary

**English-only UI with 'Disposable Income' terminology, CSS design tokens for spacing/radius, and keyboard accessibility focus indicators**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min (176 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T19:19:03Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T19:22:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Replaced all visible "Leefgeld" text with "Disposable Income" throughout UI
- Added comprehensive CSS spacing scale (xs: 4px to 2xl: 48px)
- Added border radius tokens (sm: 4px, md: 8px, lg: 12px)
- Improved scenario card shadows and hover effects (6px lift, green glow)
- Added :focus-visible outline for keyboard accessibility
- Added subtle button hover/active scale transforms
- Added comparison table row hover states

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Replace Leefgeld with Disposable Income** - `2b974f2` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Visual Polish - Spacing and Typography** - `66e7deb` (style)
3. **Task 3: Color Refinements and Final Polish** - `08ec649` (style)

## Files Created/Modified
- `autonomo_dashboard.html` - All CSS and UI text changes for localization and polish

## Decisions Made
- **Keep JavaScript variable names:** Internal variables like `leefgeld` and `optimalLeefgeld` kept as-is for backwards compatibility with localStorage and future data migration
- **"Disposable Income" terminology:** Clearer than "Leefgeld (Living Money)" for English-speaking users, describes what remains after all costs
- **6-step spacing scale:** xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl provides granular control while being easy to remember (each roughly doubles)
- **3-tier radius tokens:** sm (4px) for small elements, md (8px) for cards/buttons, lg (12px) for larger containers
- **:focus-visible over :focus:** Only shows focus ring on keyboard navigation, not mouse clicks

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all changes applied cleanly without conflicts.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- UI is now fully English with no Dutch text visible
- Spacing tokens available for future component consistency
- Focus indicators improve accessibility for keyboard users
- Ready for Phase 7.2-02 (further polish or feature work)
