# Phase 7.2 Plan 03: Mobile and Desktop Layout Audit Summary

**Comprehensive responsive CSS with mobile touch optimization, desktop layout polish, and cross-browser compatibility fixes**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T19:29:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T19:33:23Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Complete mobile layout overhaul with 600px and 400px breakpoints
- Desktop layout polish for 1440px and 1920px+ displays
- Touch-friendly 44px minimum targets on all interactive elements
- Cross-browser fixes for Safari, iOS, Chrome, and Firefox

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Mobile Layout Audit and Fixes** - `a416513` (style)
2. **Task 2: Desktop Layout Polish** - `05fbf78` (style)
3. **Task 3: Cross-Browser Compatibility Check** - `d6db75e` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified
- `autonomo_dashboard.html` - Added comprehensive responsive CSS with:
  - 768px tablet breakpoint (medium devices)
  - 400px extra-small mobile breakpoint (iPhone SE)
  - 1440px and 1920px large desktop breakpoints
  - Touch-action: manipulation for all interactive elements
  - Webkit vendor prefixes for Safari compatibility
  - Font fallback stacks and polyfills

## Decisions Made
- **768px breakpoint added** - Medium tablet devices need intermediate layout between 600px and 900px
- **400px breakpoint added** - iPhone SE and small phones need extra compact layout
- **1440px/1920px breakpoints added** - Large displays benefit from wider containers and larger elements
- **3-column tab grid on mobile** - Better fits 5 tabs than 2x3 wrap
- **Vertical expense rows on mobile** - Horizontal layout unreadable on narrow screens
- **44px minimum touch targets** - Industry standard for touch accessibility
- **structuredClone polyfill** - Older Safari (pre-15.4) doesn't support structuredClone
- **Font fallback stack** - SF Mono, Monaco, Inconsolata, etc. for systems without JetBrains Mono

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None - all three tasks completed without issues.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Responsive layout complete across all screen sizes
- Touch optimization complete for mobile devices
- Cross-browser compatibility verified via code review
- Ready for Plan 7.2-04: Human verification checkpoint
