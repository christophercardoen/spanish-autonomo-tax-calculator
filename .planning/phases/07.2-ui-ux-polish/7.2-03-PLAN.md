<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Mobile Layout Audit and Fixes</name>
  <files>autonomo_dashboard.html</files>
  <action>
Audit and fix mobile-specific layout issues.

1. **Check media query breakpoints** - Ensure these exist and are correct:
   - 600px: Mobile vertical layout
   - 768px: Tablet adjustments
   - 1024px: Desktop adjustments

2. **Fix mobile scenario cards**:
   - Cards should stack vertically on mobile
   - Card width should be 100% on narrow screens
   - Touch targets should be at least 44x44px

3. **Fix mobile comparison table**:
   - Table should switch to vertical block layout on mobile
   - Each scenario becomes a card-like block
   - All data readable without horizontal scroll

4. **Fix mobile calendar**:
   - Day cells should be large enough for touch (min 40px)
   - Week/month buttons should be accessible
   - Selection indicator should be visible

5. **Fix mobile tabs**:
   - Tab labels may need to shrink or wrap
   - Active state clearly visible on touch

6. **Fix mobile modals**:
   - Dialogs should fit within viewport
   - Close buttons accessible
   - Scroll within modal if content overflows

7. **Fix mobile expense forms**:
   - Input fields full width
   - Submit buttons large enough for touch
   - Form doesn't require horizontal scroll

Add any missing mobile-specific CSS rules.
  </action>
  <verify>
Use browser dev tools to test at 375px and 428px width:
1. All tabs accessible and readable
2. Scenario cards stack and are full width
3. Calendar days are touchable
4. Modals fit screen
5. No horizontal scroll required for main content
  </verify>
  <done>
Mobile layout issues identified and fixed. All components responsive. Touch targets adequate size. No horizontal scroll on main content.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Desktop Layout Polish</name>
  <files>autonomo_dashboard.html</files>
  <action>
Verify and polish desktop layouts at target resolutions.

1. **Test at 1920x1080 (Full HD)**:
   - Content should be well-centered with max-width
   - No excessive white space
   - Scenario cards should display in a row (4-5 visible)
   - Comparison table fully visible without scroll

2. **Test at 1440x900 (MacBook)**:
   - Content should fit well
   - Scenario cards may need horizontal scroll
   - All features accessible

3. **Verify horizontal scroll behavior**:
   - Scenario card container should scroll smoothly
   - Comparison table sticky column should work
   - No janky scroll behavior

4. **Check print layout**:
   - @media print styles should produce readable output
   - Light background for print
   - Currency values clearly visible

5. **Fix any overflow issues**:
   - Long expense names should truncate with ellipsis
   - Numbers should not overflow containers
   - Tooltips should not overflow viewport

Add CSS adjustments as needed.
  </action>
  <verify>
Test in browser at 1920x1080 and 1440x900:
1. Layout is balanced and professional
2. Scroll behavior is smooth
3. Print preview produces readable document
4. No overflow issues visible
  </verify>
  <done>
Desktop layouts verified at both resolutions. Scroll behavior smooth. Print layout correct. No overflow issues.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Cross-Browser Compatibility Check</name>
  <files>autonomo_dashboard.html</files>
  <action>
Check for and fix common cross-browser issues.

1. **CSS compatibility**:
   - Ensure all CSS uses widely-supported properties
   - Add -webkit- prefixes where needed (e.g., for Safari)
   - Check flex/grid layouts work in Safari

2. **Dialog element fallback**:
   - Verify native dialog element works in target browsers
   - Add polyfill or fallback if needed

3. **Font loading**:
   - Ensure Google Fonts load correctly
   - Add fallback fonts in font-family declarations

4. **Touch events**:
   - Verify touch events work on iOS Safari
   - Check hover states don't cause issues on touch devices

5. **localStorage**:
   - Verify localStorage works in private browsing mode (or handle errors gracefully)

Fix any issues found. This is automated code review and fix, not manual testing.
  </action>
  <verify>
