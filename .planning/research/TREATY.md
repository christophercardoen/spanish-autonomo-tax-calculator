## 183-Day Rule Basics

### What It Means

The "183-day rule" is commonly misunderstood. There are actually **two distinct applications**:

#### 1. Spanish Domestic Law (LIRPF Art. 9.1.a)
If you remain in Spanish territory for **more than 183 days during the calendar year**, you are a Spanish tax resident and must pay IRPF on worldwide income.

- Calendar year basis (1 January - 31 December)
- **Sporadic absences count as days in Spain** unless you can prove fiscal residence elsewhere
- This is just ONE of three criteria - meeting ANY ONE makes you Spanish tax resident

#### 2. Treaty Article 15 (Employment Income)
The 183-day threshold in tax treaties determines **where employment income can be taxed**, not residency. Three conditions must ALL be met for work-country taxation to NOT apply:

1. Presence in work country < 183 days (in the relevant period)
2. Remuneration NOT paid by resident employer of work country
3. Remuneration NOT borne by permanent establishment in work country

**CRITICAL FOR YOUR CASE:** Newer treaties (including Spain-Belgium) use a **12-month rolling period**, not calendar year. You cannot game year-end transitions by working July-June.

### What 204 Days in Belgium Means

With ~204 days physically present in Belgium:

| Scenario | Tax Implication |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Belgian domestic law** | Belgium could claim tax residency if you have your "main home" or "center of economic interests" there |
| **Spanish domestic law** | You likely have ~161 days in Spain (365-204), which is UNDER 183 days - so criterion (a) alone doesn't make you Spanish resident |
| **BUT** | Spanish law has TWO other criteria that DO apply to you |

## Article 4 Tie-Breaker Provisions

### Full Text of Article 4.2 (Spanish)

> "Cuando en virtud de las disposiciones del parrafo 1 una persona fisica sea residente de ambos Estados contratantes, su situacion se resolvera de la siguiente manera:
>
> a) Esa persona sera considerada residente del Estado donde tenga una **vivienda permanente** a su disposicion; si tuviera una vivienda permanente a su disposicion en ambos Estados, se considerara residente del Estado con el que mantenga relaciones personales y economicas mas estrechas (**centro de intereses vitales**);
>
> b) Si no pudiera determinarse el Estado en el que dicha persona tiene el centro de sus intereses vitales, o si no tuviera una vivienda permanente a su disposicion en ninguno de los Estados, se considerara residente del Estado contratante donde **viva habitualmente**;
>
> c) Si viviera habitualmente en ambos Estados, o no lo hiciera en ninguno de ellos, se considerara residente del Estado del que sea **nacional**;
>
> d) Si fuera nacional de ambos Estados, o no lo fuera de ninguno de ellos, las **autoridades competentes** de los Estados contratantes resolveran el caso de comun acuerdo."

### Tie-Breaker Hierarchy (Applied in Order)

```
Step 1: PERMANENT HOME
        |
        +--> Only in ONE country? --> Resident of THAT country
        |
        +--> In BOTH countries? --> Go to Step 2
        |
        +--> In NEITHER? --> Go to Step 2

Step 2: CENTRE OF VITAL INTERESTS
        |
        +--> Clearly in ONE country? --> Resident of THAT country
        |
        +--> Cannot be determined? --> Go to Step 3

Step 3: HABITUAL ABODE
        |
        +--> Lives habitually in ONE country? --> Resident of THAT country
        |
        +--> In BOTH or NEITHER? --> Go to Step 4

Step 4: NATIONALITY
        |
        +--> National of ONE country? --> Resident of THAT country
        |
        +--> National of BOTH or NEITHER? --> Go to Step 5

Step 5: MUTUAL AGREEMENT
        |
        +--> Competent authorities decide
```

### Key Definitions

#### Permanent Home (Vivienda Permanente)

Per OECD Commentary and Spanish jurisprudence:
- Any dwelling continuously available for use (owned, rented, or otherwise)
- NOT temporary accommodation (hotels, short-term rentals)
- Must be **available at all times**, not just occasionally
- A home maintained for family counts even if you're physically absent

**In your case:** You have a permanent home in Spain (where family lives). Whether you have one in Belgium depends on your accommodation arrangements there.

#### Centre of Vital Interests (Centro de Intereses Vitales)

This is the **decisive criterion** when permanent homes exist in both countries. Per OECD Commentary and Spanish Supreme Court (STS 12-06-2023, R. 915/2022):

**Personal relations include:**
- Family location (spouse, children)
- Social relationships
- Cultural/political/community activities
- Where you "live your life"

**Economic relations include:**
- Location of employment/business
- Where income is generated
- Location of patrimony (real estate, investments)
- Where assets are administered

**CRITICAL:** The OECD Commentary states that when examining the centre of vital interests, **"considerations based on the personal actions of the individual must be given special attention."** Family location is typically given significant weight.

## Application to This Case

### Your Situation Summary

| Factor | Spain | Belgium |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Days present | ~161/year | ~204/year |
| Permanent home | YES (family residence) | DEPENDS on arrangement |
| Family (spouse + child) | YES | NO |
| Domicilio fiscal | YES | NO |
| Work activity | NO (some remote?) | YES (primary work) |
| Nationality | Assumed Spanish | NO |

### Analysis Under Tie-Breaker Rules

#### Step 1: Permanent Home

**In Spain:** YES - You maintain the family residence where your partner and daughter live. This is unambiguously a permanent home.

**In Belgium:** This depends on your accommodation:
- Long-term rental you maintain year-round? = Permanent home
- Employer-provided accommodation? = Likely permanent home
- Hotel/temporary housing only when present? = NOT permanent home

**If Belgium accommodation is NOT permanent:** You are Spanish tax resident. Full stop. The analysis ends here.

**If Belgium accommodation IS permanent:** Both countries have a permanent home. Proceed to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Centre of Vital Interests

This is where your case is **strongest for Spanish residency**.

| Factor | Weighs Toward |
|--------|---------------|
| Partner resides in Spain | **SPAIN** |
| School-age daughter in Spain | **SPAIN** (strong factor) |
| Family home maintained in Spain | **SPAIN** |
| Work performed in Belgium | Belgium |
| Income source in Belgium | Belgium |
| Social/community ties | Likely **SPAIN** |
| Return pattern (weekends/holidays?) | Likely **SPAIN** |

**Spanish Supreme Court Position (STS 12-06-2023):** The "centro de intereses vitales" under the treaty is BROADER than the "nucleo de intereses economicos" in domestic law. It includes personal AND economic factors. Family location receives "special attention" per OECD Commentary.

**The key question:** Do your personal ties to Spain (family, home, community) outweigh your economic ties to Belgium (work)?

**Strong argument for Spain:** A person who maintains their family residence, whose spouse and minor child live permanently in Spain, who returns regularly, and whose life outside work hours is centered in Spain, has their centre of vital interests in Spain - even if their work requires extended presence in Belgium.

### Likely Outcome

**HIGH CONFIDENCE:** Under treaty tie-breaker rules, you should be considered **Spanish tax resident** because:

1. If your Belgium accommodation is not permanent -> Spain wins at Step 1
2. If your Belgium accommodation IS permanent -> Centro de intereses vitales analysis likely favors Spain due to:
   - Family permanently in Spain (spouse + dependent child)
   - Maintenance of family home
   - Pattern of returning to Spain
   - Personal/social life centered in Spain

---

## Centro de Intereses Vitales

### What Spanish Courts Consider

Based on 2023-2024 jurisprudence (STS 2735/2023, STS 4220/2024, STS 3881/2024):

**Personal Relations:**
- Location of spouse/partner
- Location of dependent children (VERY strong factor)
- Extended family ties
- Social relationships
- Community involvement
- Club memberships, associations
- Medical providers, dentists
- Children's schooling

**Economic Relations:**
- Where income is generated
- Location of employer/clients
- Location of real estate holdings
- Location of bank accounts
- Location of investments
- Where patrimony is administered

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Where do you spend holidays?
- Where do you spend weekends?
- Where do you return to when not working?
- Where do you vote?
- What address do you use for official purposes?

### How It's Determined

Per OECD Commentary on Article 4:

> "The circumstances must be examined as a whole, but it is nevertheless clear that **considerations based on the personal actions of the individual must be given special attention**. If a person who has a home in one State sets up a second in another State while retaining the first, the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he has always lived, where he has worked, and where he has his family and possessions, can, together with other elements, **go to demonstrate that he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first State**."

This is almost exactly your situation.

## Art. 9.1.b LIRPF Family Presumption

### The Presumption (Spanish Domestic Law)

**Article 9.1 LIRPF (Ley 35/2006)** establishes THREE criteria for Spanish tax residence:

| Criterion | Article | What It Says |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Physical presence | 9.1.a | More than 183 days in Spain during calendar year |
| Economic nucleus | 9.1.b | Main nucleus or base of economic activities/interests in Spain |
| **Family presumption** | 9.1.b (final) | Rebuttable presumption when non-separated spouse and dependent minor children habitually reside in Spain |

### Exact Text (Art. 9.1.b Final Paragraph)

> "Se presumira, salvo prueba en contrario, que el contribuyente tiene su residencia habitual en territorio espanol cuando, de acuerdo con los criterios anteriores, resida habitualmente en Espana el conyuge no separado legalmente y los hijos menores de edad que dependan de aquel."

**Translation:** It is presumed, unless proven otherwise, that the taxpayer has habitual residence in Spanish territory when, according to the previous criteria, the non-legally separated spouse and dependent minor children habitually reside in Spain.

### What This Means for You

Because your partner and daughter habitually reside in Spain:

1. **Spain PRESUMES you are Spanish tax resident** (iuris tantum presumption)
2. The burden of proof shifts to YOU to demonstrate otherwise
3. To rebut, you would need to prove:
   - You are tax resident elsewhere AND
   - That residence is your actual center of life

**IMPORTANT:** This presumption operates under DOMESTIC Spanish law. If there's a conflict with Belgium, the TREATY tie-breaker rules take precedence. But:
- Spain will START from the position that you're resident
- Belgium would need to assert its own claim
- If both claim you, the treaty resolves it (likely in Spain's favor per analysis above)

### Rebutting the Presumption

Per Audiencia Nacional jurisprudence, the presumption CAN be rebutted by showing:
- The family separation is temporary (e.g., worker transferred abroad, family to follow)
- Documented search for housing in destination country
- Children enrolled/to be enrolled in destination schools
- Clear timeline for family relocation

**This does NOT apply to you:** Your family is NOT relocating to Belgium. They live permanently in Spain. The presumption stands.

## Documentation & Evidence

### What to Maintain (CRITICAL)

To protect your Spanish tax residency position, maintain comprehensive documentation in the following categories:

#### 1. Family Ties to Spain

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Libro de familia | Proves family composition |
| Daughter's school enrollment | Proves child habitually in Spain |
| Partner's employment/activity records | Proves partner habitually in Spain |
| Family medical records (Spanish doctors) | Proves life centered in Spain |
| Utility bills for family home | Proves continuous maintenance of home |

#### 2. Your Personal Connection to Spain

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Certificado de residencia fiscal** (Agencia Tributaria) | CRITICAL - official proof of Spanish tax residence |
| Padron municipal (empadronamiento) | Registered residence |
| Voting registration | Political ties |
| Spanish bank account statements | Economic ties |
| Insurance policies (health, home, car) | Administrative ties |
| Gym/club memberships | Social ties |

#### 3. Travel Patterns

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Flight/train tickets Spain<->Belgium | Proves regular return to Spain |
| Calendar/diary of locations | Proves pattern of life |
| Credit card statements showing purchases | Shows where you spend time |
| Hotel bookings (if applicable) | Shows Belgium accommodation temporary |

#### 4. Belgium Work Arrangement

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Employment/client contracts | Shows nature of work |
| Invoices issued | Shows income source |
| Belgium accommodation contract | CRITICAL - shows permanent vs temporary |
| Belgian non-resident tax returns (if filed) | Shows you're treated as non-resident |

### The Spanish Tax Residence Certificate

**Modelo de solicitud:** Available at Agencia Tributaria

**What it proves:** Official confirmation that Spain considers you tax resident under its laws and applicable treaties.

**Why it matters (per STS 12-06-2023):** A certificate of tax residence from a treaty partner country cannot be simply ignored by the other country. It creates a strong presumption that must be resolved through treaty tie-breaker rules, not unilaterally.

**Obtain annually** and keep copies with all supporting documentation.

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Belgium Claims Tax Residency

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**What could happen:** Belgium could assert that your 204 days of physical presence, combined with work activity there, makes you Belgian tax resident. Belgian domestic law considers you resident if your "main home" or "center of economic interests" is in Belgium.

**Mitigation:**
- Ensure Belgium accommodation is clearly TEMPORARY (no long-term lease in your name)
- File Belgian non-resident tax returns (INR/BNI) declaring only Belgian-source income
- Obtain and present Spanish tax residence certificate
- Maintain documentation showing family center in Spain

### Risk 2: Double Taxation on Same Income

**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM

**What could happen:** If both countries try to tax the same income, you may face cash flow issues while waiting for double taxation relief.

**Mitigation:**
- Claim treaty relief proactively in Belgium
- File Spanish IRPF return with proper foreign tax credit claims
- Keep detailed records of taxes paid in each jurisdiction
- Consult with a cross-border tax specialist

### Risk 3: Belgian Permanent Establishment (PE) / Fixed Base

**Risk Level:** LOW (for employment), MEDIUM (for autonomo services)

**What could happen:** If you're an autonomo providing services, Belgium could argue you have a "fixed base" (base fija) there under Article 14 of the treaty, giving Belgium the right to tax income attributable to that base.

**Treaty provision (Article 14):**
> "Las rentas obtenidas por un residente de un Estado contratante por la prestacion de servicios profesionales... solo pueden someterse a imposicion en este Estado, **a no ser que dicho residente disponga de manera habitual, en el otro Estado contratante, de una base fija para el ejercicio de su actividad**. En este ultimo caso, dichas rentas pueden someterse a imposicion en el otro Estado, pero solo en la medida en que proceda atribuirlas a la base fija."

**Mitigation:**
- Avoid having a fixed office/workspace in Belgium in your name
- Work from client premises or shared spaces
- Document that Belgian presence is for client engagement, not a permanent operational base
- Structure invoicing from Spanish domicilio fiscal

### Risk 4: Future Change in Family Situation

**Risk Level:** LOW (but monitor)

**What could happen:** If family situation changes (partner moves to Belgium, daughter finishes school and leaves Spain), the tie-breaker analysis could shift.

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor situation annually
- If family moves, entire residency position must be reassessed
- Proactively manage transition if it occurs

### Risk 5: Administrative Challenge by Agencia Tributaria

**Risk Level:** LOW

**What could happen:** Spanish tax authority could question your residency, particularly under Art. 9.1.a (183 days). However, they should apply the family presumption in your favor.

**Mitigation:**
- File IRPF returns consistently as resident
- Keep "days absent" documentation if queried
- Rely on family presumption (Art. 9.1.b)
- Maintain all documentation listed above

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Treaty text and structure | HIGH | Official BOE source verified |
| Tie-breaker hierarchy | HIGH | OECD Model + official treaty consistent |
| Family presumption (LIRPF 9.1.b) | HIGH | Law text verified, jurisprudence consistent |
| Centro de intereses vitales favors Spain | MEDIUM-HIGH | Strong case based on family, but fact-specific |
| Belgium won't claim residency | MEDIUM | Depends on Belgium accommodation arrangement |
| No PE/fixed base issue | MEDIUM | Depends on work arrangement specifics |

### What's Clear

1. The Spain-Belgium treaty follows OECD Model structure for tie-breakers
2. Family location (spouse + dependent child in Spain) is a STRONG factor favoring Spanish residency under "centro de intereses vitales"
3. Spanish domestic law PRESUMES you are Spanish resident based on family situation
4. The 183-day threshold in Belgium (even at 204 days) does NOT automatically make you Belgian resident if personal ties are elsewhere

### What's Gray Area

1. **Belgium accommodation:** If you maintain a year-round lease, this complicates Step 1 analysis
2. **Economic weight:** If your ENTIRE income is Belgian-source, this creates tension with personal ties
3. **PE/Fixed base:** Autonomo work could create Belgian taxation rights on Belgian-attributable income even if you're Spanish resident
4. **Administrative practice:** How Belgian authorities actually behave may differ from strict treaty interpretation

### Recommendation

**Your position is defensible as Spanish tax resident**, but requires:
1. Proper documentation
2. Annual Spanish tax residence certificate
3. Belgian non-resident tax filings
4. Careful structuring of Belgium presence (avoid permanent accommodation in your name)
5. Professional tax advice for specific situations

## Calculator Implementation Notes

For the tax calculator, consider implementing:

### Warning Triggers

| Condition | Warning |
|-----------|---------|
| Days in Belgium >= 183 | "Exceeds 183-day threshold. Review tie-breaker rules." |
| Days in Belgium >= 183 AND no family in Spain | "HIGH RISK: Belgian residency claim possible" |
| Days in Belgium >= 183 AND permanent Belgium accommodation | "MEDIUM RISK: Document centro de intereses vitales carefully" |
| Days in Belgium >= 183 AND family in Spain | "Standard cross-border situation. Document family ties." |

### Documentation Checklist Feature

Provide a checklist of documents to maintain, with reminders:
- Annual: Tax residence certificate
- Quarterly: Travel log review
- As-needed: Update for major life changes

### Tie-Breaker Visualization

Consider a decision tree UI that walks through the hierarchy:
1. "Do you have a permanent home in Spain?" (Y/N)
2. "Do you have a permanent home in Belgium?" (Y/N)
3. If both yes: "Where is your family?" etc.
